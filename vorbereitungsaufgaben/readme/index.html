                        In the first part you will extend a given template by programming and integrating dynamic components.
                        In the second part you will design a logo and a prototype of a WebApp.
                        In the third part you will template a given design PSD.

                        and use any of the available tools. In addition to the material provided
                        it is of course up to you, if you want to produce new material or change
                        the existing one where you feel it is necessary.
                        It is not necessary to put in all the provided text and images.

                        Probably there will not be enough time to complete all formal and technical criteria.
                        Keep in mind that the goal of the competition is to deliver a running website.

                        We suggest to start with part one and continue with part two in the afternoon. However,
                        you are free to start with tasks from part two if you wish.

                        working on less weighted tasks. Possible marks are noted for each criterion beside the tasks.

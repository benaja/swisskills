                    <p>
                        <b>Situation:</b>
                        The agency Marijan Kay want to implement a game into their website.
                        Their designer already created some small websites using Wordpress.
                        However, since the requested features are very specific and they refuse
                        to use Wordpress, they tried to implement the functionality themselves.
                        The designer successfully created a design and a website template using
                        HTML and CSS. When he tried to implement the functionality, he had
                        to admit that he is in need of help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b>
                        The goal of part one is to support the designer by implementing the functionality requested
                        into the template the designer already prepared.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        <b>Situation:</b>
                        The Swiss startup <em>nate.shure.io</em> needs a WebApp where they want to present
                        their conference about nature conservancy, the schedule and pricing as well. Also they want to give their customers
                        a possibility to contact them directly through the WebApp. You work as a web designer
                        for a Swiss web agency. They already chose five color schemes.
                        The logo is still missing, which is also to be designed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b>
                        Your task is to create a new logo, which you can also embed into the WebApp in the end.
                        The second task is to design the WebApp for <em>nate.shure.io</em>. Your employer asked you to provide them
                        with the raw design file and a PNG version.

                        <b>Situation:</b>
                        You got a PSD from your designer, which you have to create a template from. He also
                        provided you the used webfont.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Special:</b>

                    <p>
                        <b>Goal:</b>
                        Your goal is to finish as much as possible of the template. The focus is set on the HTML and CSS
                        implementation of the PSD design.

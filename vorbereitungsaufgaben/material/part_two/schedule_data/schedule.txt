# Schedule

## Morning
09:00 - 09:45  [Talk]     BRINGING TOGETHER WORLD LEADERS IN RESEARCH
                          Even though there is a very broad range of possible
                          applications, the materials are very similar.
                          Typically, they are metal oxides – due to their
                          chemical stability and their unusual electronic
                          properties – or so-called higher chalcogenides.

10:00 - 10:45  [Talk]     CHILDREN LEARNING WITH NATURE
                          It’s about creating great environments whether in
                          urban settings with tiny outdoor spaces, or large
                          rural open spaces, as well as everything in between.

11:00 - 11:45  [Workshop] TOOLS FOR CONSERVATION
                          Conservation Workshop Grants support non-governmental
                          organizations, community groups, government agencies,
                          and educational institutions.

## Afternoon
13:00 - 13:45  [Talk]     NATURAL SOLUTIONS: BUILDING RESILIENCE FOR A CHANGING
                          PACIFIC
                          The people of the Pacific Islands have a long history
                          of living and coping with a highly variable climate
                          and environment. Constraints faced by Pacific islands
                          societies historically were not much different to the
                          issues faced by many Pacific societies today.

14:00 - 14:45  [Talk]     STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR NATURE CONSERVATION AND
                          PROTECTEDAREAS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND BEYOND
                          The Nature Conservation Strategy will help guide
                          future planning of the Territory’s open spaces, rural
                          areas, urban areas, riverine corridors, and nature
                          reserves, and guide investment of funding and
                          resources in nature conservation.

15:00 - 15:45  [Workshop] CONSERVATION SUCCESSES
                          This was an opportunity to discuss the preferences for
                          the selection of habitat types to be dealt with within
                          the process.
